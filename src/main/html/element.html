        <p>
            This class describes a JSON element, that is, some entity that can be an object, an array, a number,
            a string, a boolean value, or <code>null</code>. All other classes that describe the above entities
            are inherited from this class.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>An element has the following methods (which are respectively inherited by all entities):</p>
        <div class="methods_block">
            <p class="signature">JsonContainer <b>getParent()</b></p>
            <p class="description">
                Returns a container, that is, either a JSON object or a JSON array that owns this element.
                If this element is the root of the tree, the method returns <code>null</code>.<br/>
                In this way, you can traverse the tree in various directions, including from leaf to root.
                To be honest, I don't know why this is so necessary.
            </p>
            <p class="signature">JsonElement <b>clone()</b></p>
            <p class="description">
                Creates a clone of this element. If the element contains other elements, clones of these elements
                are also created, i.e. "deep" copying is performed. Thus, the result is a new (sub-)tree, which is
                not related to the original in any way.
            </p>
            <p class="signature">String <b>toString()</b></p>
            <p class="description">
                Represents the element as a string, that is, it performs serialization.
                This name instead of <code>serialize</code> was chosen because <code>toString</code> method
                is automatically called by debuggers during step-by-step execution and displaying the object's
                contents, which turns out to be quite convenient.
