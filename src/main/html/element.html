        <h1>JsonElement</h1>
        <p>
            This class describes a JSON element, that is, some entity that can be an object, an array, a number,
            a string, a boolean value, or <code>null</code>. All other classes that describe the above entities
            are inherited from this class.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>An element has the following methods (which are respectively inherited by all entities):</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 20pt;">
            <p><code>JsonContainer <b>getParent()</b></code></p>
            <p>
                Returns a container, that is, either a JSON object or a JSON array that owns this element.
                If this element is the root of the tree, the method returns <code>null</code>.<br/>
                In this way, you can traverse the tree in various directions, including from leaf to root.
                To be honest, I don't know why this is so necessary.
