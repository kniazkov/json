            enum <span class="class_name">JsonParsingMode</span>

        <p>
            Specifies the parsing mode of the JSON document.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>In total, there are three parsing modes:</p>
        <div class="methods_block">
            <p class="signature">JsonParsingMode.<b>STRICT</b></p>
            <p class="description">
                The most brutal regime. Only the syntax defined by the
                <a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404">ECMA-404 standard</a>
                ("The JSON Data Interchange Standard") is allowed.<br/>
                Parsing syntax constructs not defined by this standard will raise an exception.<br/>
                All competing parsers support this mode.
            </p>
            <p class="signature">JsonParsingMode.<b>JSON5</b></p>
            <p class="description">
                Supports <a href="http://json5.org">extended syntax</a>. Such JSON documents are easier for humans
                to read and modify. You'll love this.<br/>
                For example, you don't have to put the key in quotes:
                <pre style="padding-left: 40pt;">
{
    name: "John",
    age: 17
}
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p class="signature">JsonParsingMode.<b>EXTENDED</b></p>
            <p class="description">
                Do you make mistakes? I think I do. And that includes if you are editing a JSON document
                that is large enough to get confused.<br/>
                You might, say, accidentally forget to <s>drink your morning coffee</s> put a comma between
                two objects, like this:
                <pre style="padding-left: 40pt;">
[
    {
        name: "John",
        age: 17
    }
    {
        name: "Anna",
        age: 16
    }
]
                </pre>
                And of course, no other parser will bother with this. It would just throw an exception.<br/>
                But not this one. In this mode, we will still try to parse this somehow (and forgive the user
                who has to edit a large document <s>and hasn't had his morning coffee</s>).<br/>
                After all, we all make mistakes.<br/>
                This is the default mode unless another mode is specified.
